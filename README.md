# Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Extraction

This repository contains Natural Language Processing projects completed as part of my Master’s coursework in Automated Knowledge Base Construction. The objective was to extract structured information from unstructured text using NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition, relation extraction, and dependency parsing.

These techniques are widely used in industry for applications such as:
- extracting insights from customer feedback
- analyzing business documents
- building knowledge graphs
- automating information extraction from text

## Contribution:

The project framework was provided as part of the course, and I implemented the core NLP logic to:
- Extract named entities from text
- Identify relationships between entities
- Extract subject-predicate-object triples
- Process and filter extracted information
- Analyze and structure unstructured textual data

Example:
Input text:
"Albert Einstein was born in Germany and worked as a physicist."

Extracted structured data:
- **Entity**: Albert Einstein
- **Profession**: Physicist
- **Country of birth**: Germany
